# ConsistAI

⚠️ **Important Note**: This is a theoretical framework that proposes novel evaluation methods for knowledge editing. It has not been empirically tested and is presented as a conceptual contribution building on existing research. The implementation serves as a starting point for future experimental validation.

## Features

**Core Evaluation Components**
- Chain-of-thought verification system
- Semantic drift tracking
- Knowledge graph infrastructure 
- Temporal consistency validation
- Edit rejection analysis

**Built on Research**
- Evaluation methodology from "HalluEditBench" (Huang et al., 2024)
- Memory editing concepts from "Mass-Editing Memory in a Transformer" (Meng et al., 2023)
- Model editing techniques from "Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT" (Meng et al., 2022)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from editing_framework import EditEvaluator, EditInstance
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Initialize framework
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("model_name")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("model_name")
evaluator = EditEvaluator(model, tokenizer)

# Create edit instance
edit = EditInstance(
    id="edit_001",
    subject="OpenAI",
    relation="CEO",
    original_object="Sam Altman",
    target_object="Emmett Shear",
    domain="technology",
    topic="companies"
)

# Evaluate edit
results = evaluator.evaluate_edit(edit)
```

## Components

**ChainOfThoughtVerifier**
- Validates edits using reasoning templates
- Generates verification queries
- Calculates confidence scores

```python
verification = thought_verifier.verify_edit(edit)
```

**SemanticDriftTracker**
- Measures semantic changes post-edit
- Tracks neighborhood effects
- Provides drift severity metrics

```python
drift_metrics = drift_tracker.track_drift(edit)
```

**KnowledgeGraph**
- Maintains fact relationships
- Enforces temporal consistency
- Checks for conflicting edits

```python
consistency = knowledge_graph.check_consistency(entity)
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The framework evaluates edits across multiple dimensions:

**Consistency**
- Temporal consistency: Tracks changes over time
- Relational consistency: Validates relationship logic
- Graph-based validation: Ensures knowledge graph coherence

**Semantic Analysis**
- Cosine drift: Measures embedding space changes
- Neighborhood effects: Analyzes impact on related concepts
- Embedding distance: Quantifies semantic shifts

**Verification**
- Reasoning chain validity: Evaluates logical consistency
- Confidence scoring: Assesses edit reliability
- Conflict detection: Identifies contradictions

## Example Output

```python
{
    'edit_id': 'edit_001',
    'status': 'accepted',
    'consistency': {
        'temporal': [],
        'relational': []
    },
    'semantic_drift': {
        'cosine_drift': 0.82,
        'neighbor_drift': 0.76,
        'drift_severity': 'low'
    },
    'verification': {
        'confidence_score': 0.89,
        'reasoning_chain': [...],
        'potential_conflicts': []
    }
}
```

## Theoretical Foundations

This framework proposes several novel theoretical contributions:

1. Chain-of-thought verification system extends the basic evaluation methods from HalluEditBench by introducing structured reasoning paths.

2. Semantic drift tracking introduces a new theoretical approach to measuring knowledge consistency through embedding space analysis.

3. The knowledge graph infrastructure proposes a theoretical model for tracking temporal and relational consistency of edits.

The actual effectiveness of these methods requires empirical validation through future research.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- Transformers 4.20+
- NetworkX 2.6+

## Future Research Directions

1. Empirical validation of the proposed metrics
2. Comparison with existing evaluation frameworks
3. Extension to multi-modal knowledge editing
4. Integration with various LLM architectures
5. Development of standardized benchmarks

## Contributing

This is a theoretical framework open for academic discussion and improvement. Contributions that enhance the theoretical foundation or propose validation methods are welcome.
